Introduction

Features of the PRAM framework:

- Models on an agent population level instead of the level of individual agents by grouping functionally equivalent agents into ``groups``
- Allows groups of agents to be related to one or more ``sites`` (e.g., a school the agents attend to or a opinion they share)
- Lifts the domain (and thus offers lifted inference)
- Models agent population mass dynamics as mass shift (or transfer) between groups
- Agent population mass dynamics observes axioms of probability
- Is equivalent to compartmental models but without imposing the requirement of specifying all compartments beforehand (i.e., groups are created automatically when necessary)

Additional features more specific to the implementation in the PyPRAM package:

- Attempts to integrate and unify other modeling and simulation frameworks (e.g., ABMs, compartmental models, redistribution systems, ordinary-differential equations, Markov chains, etc.)
- Allows modelers to compose complicated models from smaller parts called `modeling primitives`
- Organizes modeling primitives into a multigraph
- Inheritance-based hierarchies expressed within the modeling primitives multigraph explicitly encode specialization and generalization
- Provides systemic diagnostics
  - Mass dynamics visualization
  - Time-frequency analysis
  - Recurrence quantification analysis
  - Etc.
