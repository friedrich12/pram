Probabilistic Relational Agent-based Models (PRAMs) is a modeling and simulation framework that puts agent-based models (ABMs) on a sound probabilistic foundation.  When compared to equivalent ABMs, PRAMs are:

- More space- and time-efficient (due to agent population encoding)
- More sound (due to probabilistic foundation)
- More expressive (due to allowing relations)
